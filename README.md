# Pounce & Portal

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Pounce & Portal, a cat-themed 2D platformer with destruction physics and portal mechanics. This README will provide you with essential information about the project and how you can get involved as a student participant.

## About Pounce & Portal

In this game, you'll step into the paws of a cat as you navigate a whimsical world filled with colorful creatures inspired by retro video games. What sets this game apart is its emphasis on destruction physics, allowing you to smash objects, trigger explosions, and create chaos as you progress through the levels. In addition, portals allow you to teleport and leap through areas.  We aim to deliver...

- **Destruction Physics**
